There are two ways to create a table: using function knitr::kable() or using markdown syntax

| Description | Value |
|:------------|:------|
| Species     | Nikto |
| Gender      | Male  |
| Eye Color   | Black |
| Skin Color  | Green |

Now use markdown syntax to create the table

| Description | Value |

| Skin Color  | Green |

Cooking Recipe
--------------

The food I choose is *peanut sesame noodles*. Here is some information about it. (More information in [this website](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/04/peanut-sesame-noodles/).)

-   **Ingredients**
    -   For *peanut dressing*
        -   1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
        -   1/4 cup soy sauce
        -   1/3 cup warm water
        -   1 tablespoon chopped peeled fresh ginger
        -   1 medium garlic clove, chopped
        -   2 tablespoons rice vinegar
        -   1 1/2 tablespoons Asian toasted sesame oil
        -   1 tablespoon honey
        -   1 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes or a splash of the hot sauce or chili paste of
        -   your choice
    -   For *noodles*
        -   3/4 lb dried soba nooodles (dried linguine fini or spaghetti will work in a pinch)
        -   4 scallions, thinly sliced
        -   1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/8-inch-thick strips
        -   1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1/8-inch-thick strips
        -   Half a seedless cucumber, thinly sliced
        -   1 cup firm or extra-firm tofu, cubed
        -   3 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted
-   **Kitchen tools**
    -   A blender
    -   A large bowl
    -   A colander
-   **Steps**
    1.  Puree dressing ingredients in a blender until smooth, about 2 minutes, then transfer to a large bowl
    2.  Cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until tender. Drain in a colander, then rinse well under cold water
    3.  Add pasta, scallions, bell peppers, cucumber and tofu to dressing, tossing to combine. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and serve immediately

#### Additional comment

There isn't a special season of the year for eating peanut sesame noodles but maybe it is better to eat it in a warm spring night!
As for variations of the recipe, you can replace the ingredients mentioned above with some other Chinese vegies like bok choy and choy sum, Chinese cabbage, carrots, red peppers, etc.

Euclidean Distance
------------------

Here is the definition of Euclidean Distance.

### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\mathbf{pq}}$).
In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, …, *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, …, *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):
The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$\\Vert \\mathbf{p}\\Vert=\\sqrt{p\_{1}^{2}+p\_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+p\_{n}^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\mathbf{p}\\centerdot\\mathbf{p}},$$
 where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
